```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

misinfo_d <- read_csv('../data/life-under-lockdown-wave2-extract.csv')
```

```{r}
misinfo_d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
misinfo_d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = beliefs)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 6)
```

```{r}
mean(misinfo_d$beliefs)
```

```{r}
misinfo_d %>%
  filter(gender %in% c('Male', 'Female')) %>%
  t.test(formula = beliefs ~ gender, data = .)
```

In the sample, males had more misinformation beliefs (M = 0.73) than females (M = 0.61), but this was not statistically significant, t(491.31) = -1.201, p = 0.230.
